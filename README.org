* evil-unimpaired

This repository contains a port of Tim Pope's [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired][unimpaired.vim]]. This
code was originally copied from Spacemacs and you can find the
original source [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/layers/%252Bspacemacs/spacemacs-evil/local/evil-unimpaired/evil-unimpaired.el][here]].

This package contains useful "pairs" of functions that are opposites
of each other (e.g. next/previous buffer, paste above/below,
etc). They are bound to the default leaders keys of =[= and =]=.

** Usage
evil-unimpaired is a global minor mode that can be enabled by calling
=(evil-unimpaired-mode)= and disabled with =(evil-unimpaired-mode -1)=

** Default Pairs
These pairs come included with evil-unimpaired

| key | previous function                  | next function                      |
|-----+------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| SPC | evil-unimpaired-insert-space-above | evil-unimpaired-insert-space-below |
| b   | previous-buffer                    | next-buffer                        |
| f   | evil-unimpaired-previous-file      | evil-unimpaired-next-file          |
| t   | evil-unimpaired-previous-frame     | evil-unimpaired-next-frame         |
| w   | previous-multiframe-window         | next-multiframe-window             |
| p   | evil-unimpaired-paste-above        | evil-unimpaired-paste-below        |

For example you would use =[ b= to get previous buffer and =] f= to get the next file
** Configuration

*** Changing the Leader Keys
the leader key can be set to any key or sequence of keys using =evil-unimpaired-leader-keys=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq evil-unimpaired-leader-keys '("gk" . "gj"))
#+END_SRC

*** Adding or Removing Pairs
pairs can be added or removed by editing
=evil-unimpaired-default-pairs= before =evil-unimpaired-mode= is
enabled. They can also be added using =evil-unimpaired-define-pair=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (evil-unimpaired-define-pair "e" '(move-text-up . move-text-down) '(normal visual))
  (evil-unimpaired-define-pair "q" '(flycheck-previous-error . flycheck-next-error))
#+END_SRC

*** Evil States
The state(s) where the keybinds are active is set by
=evil-unimpaired-state=. By default this is set to ='normal=.

To let evil-unimpaired work in read only buffers set it to ='motion=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-list
  (setq evil-unimpaired-state 'motion) 
#+END_SRC
